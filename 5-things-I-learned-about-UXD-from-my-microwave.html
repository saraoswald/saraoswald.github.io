            <h2>5 things I learned about UXD from my microwave</h2>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
I don't know how to use my microwave. It's one of the most basic appliances in my apartment, and one of the most difficult to use. While struggling to heat my food I've learned a couple things about User Experience Design (UXD) -- or lack thereof. 
</p>


<h3>1. Know your audience </h3>
<p>
A tool UX designers use is to create "personas", where you imagine exactly who would use your product and what they want out of it. A college student wants to nuke a hot pocket. A child wants to warm up a snack. An American wants to boil a cup of water. All of these personas want to spend as little time dealing with the microwave's UI, so that they can finally eat their food. It takes me at least 3 times longer than it should to figure out how to use this UI, and I can't even imagine how a child would be able to use it. 
</p>

<h3>2. Do user testing </h3>
<p>
One of the best ways to learn about your design is to put it in front of real users. Give them a task to accomplish, observe how they use the UI, get their feedback, and then apply that feedback. When I look at the minefield of options on my microwave, I don't even know where to start. Buttons I thought would do one thing do another, and some buttons don't do anything at all. I'm not completely sure the defrost function even works. 
</p>
<p>
This could have been avoided by watching users try to do anything on this UI. Product development shouldn't be a vacuum, and the best way to give consumers what they want is to ask them what they want.
</p>

<h3>3. Resist feature creep</h3>
<p>
Has anyone in all of existence ever used that popcorn button? When I microwave something, it's going in for 2 minutes. If it's not done, it goes in for another 2 minutes. It's like someone imagined American households nuking a fresh bag of popcorn every night and marveling in the fact that there's a button just for them. 
</p>
<p>
Even if something sounds like a good idea in a brainstorming meeting, that doesn't mean it is. Bringing in a new feature should only be considered if a high enough percentage of users will actually use it, and if it genuinely adds value to the product. Otherwise, you end up with bloat.

<h3>4. Don't rely on a manual or user guide</h3>
<p>
It would be great if I knew how to defrost things in the microwave, but my only hope, the manual, is long gone. Design should speak for itself, and expecting the user to consult a guide to do basic things is lazy. Proper user testing would have virtually prevented the need for a user manual, as the production team could have identified pain points and corrected them. 
</p>

<h3>5. If it ain't broke don't fix it</h3>
<p>
When you do an image search for "microwave", you can see an army of identical faces. Wide rectangle with a door taking up most of the body and a control panel of buttons on the right. This basic layout has lasted not just because it's familiar, but because it works.

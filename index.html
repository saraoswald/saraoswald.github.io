            <h1>Getting Started Scripting in InDesign</h1>
            <h3>This tutorial will cover how set up the environment to start writing scripts to use in InDesign.</h3>

            <h2>Setup</h2>
            <p>First, download <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>, which is where you'll be writing all of your code. You'll also need to install the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=renderTom.adobe-script-runner">Adobe Script Runner extension</a>.</p>
            <p>By default, Adobe Script Runner is set up for After Effects. To configure it for InDesign, open Keyboard Shortcuts, search for "adobescriptrunner", and reset the keybinding for Command+R to be for InDesign. <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings">Refer to this guide for help with binding keyboard shortcuts.</a></p>
            <img src="./files/Keyboard-shortcuts.png">

            <h2>Sample Script</h2>
            <p>Now it's time to write your first script! Now's the time to make sure you have InDesign open.</p>
            <p>Open a new text file (Command+N), and paste the script below into it.</p>
            <pre>alert("Hello World")</pre>
            <p>When you press Command+R, you should get this popup in InDesign.</p>
            <img src="./files/ID-hello-world.png">
            <p>And that's all there is to it! Happy coding!</p>

            <h1>Macro Scenarios Widget</h1>
            <h2>JavaScript - LESS - Handlebars</h2>
            <p>A part of the Credit Analytics suite, this widget gives the ability to calculate outcomes from financial models for multiple scenarios at once, as opposed to calculating each company separately. The user inputs various macroeconomic factors,
                and this widget provides generated model output, industry and country benchmarks, and integration with the LSM model.</p>
            <p>The user has the ability to provide an infinite amount of scenarios, compared against a control (left) and weighted average (far right). There are arrows to shift left and right between scenarios, and the dots at the bottom indicate to the
                user where they are.</p>
            <p>All of the Highcharts graphs are synchronized by legend filtering and relative bar heights, and they aren't rendered until they are visible on the page. The first point is accomplished by calculating the relative maximum of all the data points
                on load, and the second point by rendering indexes 0, 1, and 2, and waiting until the user clicks the right arrow to render graphs at indexes > 3.</p>

            <p>This widget was built with ES6 (Babel), LESS, Handlebars. If I had more time I would've build this with CSS Grid instead of <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>, so that I could add better CSS animations as the user flips horizontally through scenarios.</p>

            <h1>CIQ Settings Dialog</h1>
            <p>This is a great example of how difficult it can be to transform complicated business logic into something the user will understand intuitively. I believe that communicating business logic is more effective through thoughtful UXD than it is
                through blocks of text.</p>
            <p>After we added a "Basic" (simplified) view of different widgets and pages, we needed a place to toggle that setting for each individual piece.</p>
            <p>We decided to reuse an old settings dialog, which previously had a checkbox to apply a special template to various widgets. Since we were adding not only a new setting but also new widgets that weren't affected by the old templating, I landed
                on radio buttons.</p>

            <div class="caption">User Settings dialog from the S&P Capital IQ platform, built with Vanilla JS.</div>
            <p>The user had to be able to batch-apply settings, but they also needed a handy discription of each "View". We gave the user large buttons at the top of the dialog, while still allowing the user to toggle each setting individually.</p>
            <p>The radio buttons are all left aligned to emphasize the fact that the "None" option isn't available to all areas.</p>
            <p>The biggest challenge of this project was the location of the dialog's code. Since it's on a platform dashboard, I didn't have access to any JS/CSS/HTML preprocessers. I had to write cross-browser JS and CSS animations without the safety net
                of modern technologies like arrow functions and automatic polyfills.</p>

            <h1>Manga Retouching</h1>
            <p>Part of localizing Japanese comics is Photoshopping all of the non-English elements off the page while making sure that the integrity of the art remains. This can range from simple retouches to complete reconstruction, depending on the series.

            <h1>Text Layout and Format Conventions</h1>
            <p>One method that letterers use to evoke different types of storytelling is to use different text styles. For inner dialog, we use italics. For narration, we might use a different font face. For aside text, we might use all lowercase.</p>
            <p>When these styles are used consistently across the series, it allows the reader to process that extra context effortlessly. Like with all aspects of lettering, if it's done correctly, the reader won't even notice it.</p>

            <h1>Sound Effects</h1>
            <p>Placing the translation of sound effects onto the manga is a more involved process than normal dialog. It's the letterer's responsibility to match the style and inflection of the original artist's work, without being so flashy it detracts
                from the reading experience.</p>
